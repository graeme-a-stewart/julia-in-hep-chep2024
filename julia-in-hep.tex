\abstract{%
Julia is a mature general-purpose programming language, with a large ecosystem
of libraries and more than 10000 third-party packages, which specifically
targets scientific computing. As a language, Julia is as dynamic, interactive,
and accessible as Python with NumPy, but achieves run-time performance on par
with C/C++. In this paper, we describe the state of adoption of Julia in HEP,
where momentum has been gathering over a number of years.

HEP-oriented Julia packages can, via \texttt{UnROOT.jl}, already read HEP's
major file formats, including TTree and RNTuple formats. Interfaces to some of
HEP's major software packages, such as through \texttt{Geant4.jl}, are available
too. Jet reconstruction algorithms in Julia show excellent performance. A number
of full HEP analyses have been performed in Julia.

We show how, as the support for HEP has matured, developments have benefited
from Julia's core design choices, which makes reuse from and integration with
other packages easy. In particular, libraries developed outside HEP for
plotting, statistics, fitting, and scientific machine learning are extremely
useful.

We believe that the powerful combination of flexibility and speed, the wide
selection of scientific programming tools, and support for all modern
programming paradigms and tools, make Julia the ideal choice for a future
language in HEP.}

\section{Programming Languages in High-Energy Physics}
\label{sec:introduction}

\subsection{HEP Needs}

High-energy physics (HEP) is a large field, consisting of tens of thousands of
researchers, almost all of whom will need to interact with software and
contribute to software projects during their careers~\cite{2024EPJWC.29505023M}.
It is also one of the biggest, if not the biggest, generators of scientific
datasets today, with exabytes of storage used by the LHC
experiments~\cite{Collaboration:2904204}. This data is processed by a huge
corpus of software, estimated to be many tens of millions of lines in
C++~\cite{hsfcwp}.

This brings a challenge for HEP software. From the point of view of \emph{code
efficiency} we require fast and efficient execution, high throughput, and
scalability at large computer centres and across distributed infrastructures.
Considering \emph{human efficiency} we would like a low barrier to entry for
newcomers, the ability to prototype code rapidly, a broad ecosystem of well
maintained packages, and excellent tooling for developers. These features are
needed to make software able to deal efficiently with huge datasets, as well as
accessible to a large group of developers.

\subsection{From Fortran to the C++/Python Era}

In response to changing technology, and the needs of the field, the programming
languages that are dominant in the field have evolved over time.
From~\cite{pivarski2022} we can identify three major shifts as seen in
\ref{fig:hep-languages}.

        \label{fig:hep-languages}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{description}
    \item[From assembler to Fortran] As computers developed from early
    specialised behemoths, with barely an operating system, improved programming
    languages became available. For technical computing Fortran was the most
    effective language and HEP quickly adopted it as it brought a much improved
    syntax, as well as hardware portability.
    \item[From Fortan to C++] Although Fortran had many advantages, HEP had to
    develop language extensions to introduce concepts such as more advanced data
    structures~\cite{Zoll:2296399}. A language which offered native object
    orientation was an attractive choice. In addition, the gap afforded by the
    end of the LEP accelerator and the construction of the LHC allowed the field
    to afford the time for a major language shift.
    \item[The rise of Python] Python earned a well deserved reputation as an
    excellent language for programming efficiency, and also gained ground
    through being the de facto interface to many machine learning libraries. It
    has become widely used in HEP as a compliment to C++.
\end{description}

The current situation for HEP is that C++ and Python are now both widely used,
with each bringing specific advantages, as well as drawbacks. Good C++ excels at
runtime efficiency, but is a difficult language to learn and master as well as
suffering from memory safety issues and being difficult to compose. Python is
expressive, much easier to work with, is safer with memory and composes better
(duck typing). However, it is very slow compared to C++, so not suitable for
high throughput computing.

As noted in~\cite{eschle2023potential}, using two languages is not ideal: it
increases the required expertise, necessitates reimplementation of code for
performance, and reduces code reusability.

\section{Julia}

\subsection{Julia's Motivations}

Some of the design goals of the language. \emph{Julia Programming
Language}~\cite{bib:julia_freshapproach,10.1145/3276490}

The Julia programming language was announced formally to the world in 2012 with a blog post entitled "Why We Created Julia"\cite{bib:why-create-julia}.
This document lists a series of ambitious goals for the language, and represents a view into the core developers' mindset, supplemented by the follow-up 
community-contributed article "Why We Use Julia, 10 Years Later"\cite{why-julia-10}. 

Julia's design attempts to provide a syntax as productive as Python, especially for numerical work, whilst leveraging JAOT\footnote{Just-Ahead-Of-Time} compilation to provide execution times
on the order of those of compiled, statically typed languages like C and Rust. It utilises type inference - like that added post-hoc to C++, and as present in other 
modern language by default - to allow the programmer add as much, or as little, detailed constraint to a program as they need. Like MatLab and Fortran,
Julia's native operations and type system support arrays as first-class entities, of any dimension, allowing array-oriented code to be both
productively generated, and efficiently executed, with operations naturally "broadcasted" element- or dimension-wise. 

%Design goals and aims
%Open source
%Speed like C, but dynamic like Ruby/Python
%Obvious mathematical notation
%General purpose like Python
%As easy for statistics as R
%Powerful linear algebra like in Matlab
%Good for gluing programs together like the shell


\subsection{Julia in Practice}

Some code examples - demonstrate \emph{ease} and also give some benchmarks for
speed.



%Tooling and ecosystem.
As with other languages of the 2010s, Julia comes with a set of tools for managing development environments beyond the interpreter.

`juliaup` allows seamless management of multiple Julia releases on the same machine, including tracking particular patch releases, and 
choosing the system default.

The integrated package management in Julia - via the Pkg library, or a sub-environment within a Julia REPL accessed by pressing '$]$', 
tracks and maintains the dependency graph of a Julia project. State is entirely stored within two human-readable files - Manifest.toml and Project.toml
. The user of a Julia codebase can easily reproduce the exact environment needed for the codebase, to the level of dependencies of 
dependencies of packages, by simply using the "instantiate" command as long as the Project.toml file is provided.
The Julia Package "General Registry" indexes packages and their releases, and (as with other languages such as Rust and Javascript) relies on a public
index hosted on GitHub (with off-GitHub backups).

Leveraging the fact that Julia is JAOT-compiled, and that this allows its entire standard library to be written in idiomatic Julia, the REPL also provides
a series of powerful macro utilities for inspecting the byte- and machine-code generated for a given expression (\verb$@code_lowered$, \verb$@code_native$) and
for locating and displaying the source code for any function in the current namespace, including from the standard library (\verb$@less$), as well as other introspection
tools.
A help environment, accessed by "?" on an empty line of the REPL, allows interactive help on any keyword or symbol known to the REPL's current state. This relies 
on docstrings, but extended introspection tools are also available in optional packages (such as \texttt{About.jl}, which can provide information 
on memory layout of datatypes and thread safety of functions).

\subsection{HEP Data Formats}

We can read that data... UpROOT.jl. EDM4hep.jl.

\subsection{Event Generators}

A bit about QuantumElectrodynamics.jl.

\subsection{Simulation}

Detector simulation is a crucial component of every High Energy Physics (HEP) experiment, playing a key role both during the design and conception of the detector and later in data analysis. The most widely used toolkit for this purpose is Geant4 \cite{GEANT4:2002zbu}, a C++-based framework with over 2 million lines of code.

Given its complexity and extensive adoption, a complete rewrite of Geant4 in a new language is highly impractical. Instead, this presents an opportunity to explore Julia's interoperability with other languages. One particular challenge arises from Geant4's callback-based user interface, which relies on C++ virtual methods invoked at specific points during particle transport. Application developers must implement these callbacks to configure and control the simulation and extract relevant simulated data. However, integrating this mechanism in Julia is more complex than in other languages, as Julia does not natively support virtual methods.

The Geant4.jl \cite{geant4-jl-github} package has been developed to provide a Julia interface to Geant4. It leverages CxxWrap.jl \cite{cxxwrap-jl-github}, a package that enables calling C++ functions and types from Julia. Similar to Python’s static bindings, invoking C++ code from Julia requires explicit wrapper definitions for each method exposed to Julia. However, given Geant4's large and complex codebase, manually writing and maintaining these wrappers is not a viable approach, especially for making it more sustainable with future toolkit updates. To address this, we use WrapIt \cite{wrapit-github}, a package that automates wrapper generation by utilizing the Clang library to parse C++ header files and extract class declarations. This automation significantly reduces development effort and ensures long-term maintainability of the interface.

Integrating Geant4 with Julia allows researchers to take advantage of Julia's high-level programming capabilities and performance benefits while retaining the full functionality and efficiency of the Geant4 toolkit. This integration also provided an opportunity to rethink and streamline the interface, making it more intuitive and user-friendly. In particular, we focused on ensuring that application developers can concentrate on the essential aspects of their simulations while minimizing configuration overhead. Boilerplate code and C++ idiosyncrasies are hidden, allowing for a cleaner, more concise approach to defining simulations. The performance of the Geant4.jl package is comparable to that of the native C++ Geant4 toolkit, demonstrating the feasibility of using Julia for HEP detector simulation.
