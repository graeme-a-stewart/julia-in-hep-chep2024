  abstract = {Quantum chromodynamics, the theory of the strong force, describes interactions of coloured quarks and gluons and the formation of hadronic matter. Conventional hadronic matter consists of baryons and mesons made of three quarks and quark-antiquark pairs, respectively. Particles with an alternative quark content are known as exotic states. Here a study is reported of an exotic narrow state in the D0D0$\pi$+ mass spectrum just below the D*+D0 mass threshold produced in proton-proton collisions collected with the LHCb detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The state is consistent with the ground isoscalar {\$}{\$}{\{}{\{}{\{}{\{}{\{}{\{}{\backslash}rm{\{}T{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}{\_}{\{}{\{}{\{}{\{}{\{}{\{}{\backslash}rm{\{}c{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\{}{\{}{\{}{\backslash}rm{\{}c{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}^{\{}+{\}}{\$}{\$}tetraquark with a quark content of {\$}{\$}{\{}{\{}{\{}{\{}{\{}{\backslash}rm{\{}c{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\{}{\{}{\{}{\backslash}rm{\{}c{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}{\backslash}overline{\{}{\{}{\{}{\{}{\{}{\{}{\backslash}rm{\{}u{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}{\backslash}overline{\{}{\{}{\{}{\{}{\{}{\{}{\backslash}rm{\{}d{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}and spin-parity quantum numbers JP{\thinspace}={\thinspace}1+. Study of the DD mass spectra disfavours interpretation of the resonance as the isovector state. The decay structure via intermediate off-shell D*+ mesons is consistent with the observed D0$\pi$+ mass distribution. To analyse the mass of the resonance and its coupling to the D*D system, a dedicated model is developed under the assumption of an isoscalar axial-vector {\$}{\$}{\{}{\{}{\{}{\{}{\{}{\{}{\backslash}rm{\{}T{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}{\_}{\{}{\{}{\{}{\{}{\{}{\{}{\backslash}rm{\{}c{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\{}{\{}{\{}{\backslash}rm{\{}c{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}^{\{}+{\}}{\$}{\$}state decaying to the D*D channel. Using this model, resonance parameters including the pole position, scattering length, effective range and compositeness are determined to reveal important information about the nature of the {\$}{\$}{\{}{\{}{\{}{\{}{\{}{\{}{\backslash}rm{\{}T{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}{\_}{\{}{\{}{\{}{\{}{\{}{\{}{\backslash}rm{\{}c{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\{}{\{}{\{}{\backslash}rm{\{}c{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}}^{\{}+{\}}{\$}{\$}state. In addition, an unexpected dependence of the production rate on track multiplicity is observed.},

It is used by a large number of experiments and projects in a variety of application domains, including high energy physics, astrophysics and space science, medical physics and radiation protection. Over the past several years, major changes have been made to the toolkit in order to accommodate the needs of these user communities, and to efficiently exploit the growth of computing power made available by advances in technology. The adaptation of Geant4 to multithreading, advances in physics, detector modeling and visualization, extensions to the toolkit, including biasing and reverse Monte Carlo, and tools for physics and release validation are discussed here.}

  abstract = {The software needs of scientists and engineers are growing and their programs are becoming more compute-heavy and problem-specific. This has led to an influx of non-expert programmers, who need to use and program high-performance computing platforms. With the continued stagnation of single-threaded performance, using hardware accelerators such as GPUs or FPGAs is necessary. Adapting software to these compute platforms is a difficult task, especially for non-expert programmers, leading to applications being unable to take advantage of new hardware or requiring extensive rewrites. We propose a programming model that allows non-experts to benefit from high-performance computing, while enabling expert programmers to take full advantage of the underlying hardware. In this model, programs are generically typed, the location of the data is encoded in the type system, and multiple dispatch is used to select functionality based on the type of the data. This enables rapid prototyping, retargeting and reuse of existing software, while allowing for hardware specific optimization if required. Our approach allows development to happen in one source language enabling domain experts and performance engineers to jointly develop a program, without the overhead, friction, and challenges associated with developing in multiple programming languages for the same project. We demonstrate the viability and the core principles of this programming model in Julia using realistic examples, showing the potential of this approach for rapid prototyping, and its applicability for real-life engineering. We focus on usability for non-expert programmers and demonstrate that the potential of the underlying hardware can be fully exploited.}
